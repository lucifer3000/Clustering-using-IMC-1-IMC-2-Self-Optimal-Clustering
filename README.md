# Clustering-using-IMC-1-IMC-2-Self-Optimal-Clustering

The performance of various clustering
algorithms are being compared. The custering algorithms that
are being compared are K-Means, Fuzzy-C Means, Improved
Mountain Clustering - 1 (IMC-1), Improved Mountain Clustering -2 (IMC-2) and Self-Optimal Clustering. The quantitative
and qualitative performances of all these well-known clustering
techniques are presented and compared with the aid of examples
on various benchmarked validation indices which are Global
Silhouette Index(GSI), partition index(PI), separation index(SI),
and Dunn index(DI).
